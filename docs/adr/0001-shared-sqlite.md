# Shared SQLite

Status: Accepted for the #31 implementation; see crg-3uv.6 and crg-3uv.7.

When shared storage is selected, CRG owns one SQLite file. A connection binds
one canonical checkout before resolving any graph tables. The checkout
namespace covers native nodes, edges, metadata, FTS, embeddings, flows and
communities; SQLite stores all of them in the same WAL database. Existing
single-checkout indexes stay where they are. Rebuild from source to populate
the shared file.

A refresh owns the native writer lock for that file and publishes its changes
together in one transaction. An interrupted writer loses the kernel lock and
its uncommitted changes. A caller may reuse a completion only for its own
checkout, matching inputs and graph profile. The watcher and tool callers use
the same writer and completion records.

A parser worker may reuse a syntax tree for identical preprocessed bytes
and the same loaded grammar. It still extracts nodes and resolves names for
each checkout. Syntax trees are retained only in a bounded worker-local
cache; the SQLite database is the only durable graph store.

AI Hub selects and supervises the engine; it does not own graph data or
refresh leases. Its runtime acceptance and activation remain governed by
AI Hub ADR 0026 and ADR 0030.
